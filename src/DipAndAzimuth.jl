function DipAndAzimuth( Triangles,Points,FaceNormalVector )
# DipAndAzimuth: Creates and plots the dip, azimuth and 
#                   strike of the surface in degrees. Plots the dip and
#                   azimuth of the surface and also exports these as column
#                   vectors. Result is independant of the surface's
#                   normals.
#               
# usage #1:
# (Dip,Azimuth,Strike) = DipAndAzimuth( Triangles,Points,FaceNormalVector )
#
# Arguments: (input)
# FaceNormalVector - The normal vector of the triangles of the surface.
#
#
# Points            - Columns 2 3 and 4 are the XYZ locations of one the
#                    corner points of a triangle. Column 1 is the index. 
#
# Triangles         -  Triangles is a list where each row contains 3 index
#                     locations in "Points" which contains the XYZ location
#                     of each corner of the triangle.
#
# Arguments: (output)
#  Dip             - Dip of the surface (angle away from horizontal).
#
#  Azimuth         - Direction of the dip of the surface.
#
#  Strike          - Direction perpendicular to Azimuth (90 degrees counter
#
# Example usage:
#
# [x,y] = meshgrid(-2:.2:2);                                
# z = x .* exp(-x.^2 - y.^2);
# Triangles = delaunay(x(:),y(:));
# Points=[[1:numel(x)]',x(:),y(:),z(:)];
# [MidPoint,FaceNormalVector] = MidPointCreate(Points,Triangles);
# [Dip,Azimuth,Strike] = DipAndAzimuth( Triangles,Points,FaceNormalVector);
